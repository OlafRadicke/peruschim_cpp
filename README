Build
-----

peruschim_cpp is now built using autotools.

To build peruschim_cpp do the following steps:

  * check out the latest version from github (https://github.com/OlafRadicke/peruschim_cpp)
  * run "autoreconf -i"
  * run "./configure"
  * run "make"

You get a binary in src/peruschim_cpp.

Alternatively you can build it into another directory. You have to run configure
from that directory then like this:

  * run "autoreconf -i"
  * run "mkdir build"
  * run "cd build"
  * run "../configure"
  * run "make"

Then you have all generated files in that build directory.
